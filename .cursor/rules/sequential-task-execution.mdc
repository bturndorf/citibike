# Cursor Agent Rule: Sequential Task Execution

Rules for ensuring the Cursor Agent follows the project plan sequentially.

<rule>
name: sequential_task_execution
description: Enforces sequential execution of tasks from PROJECT_PLAN.md
filters:
  # Match when PROJECT_PLAN.md is referenced
  - type: content
    pattern: "PROJECT_PLAN\\.md"
  # Match task-related queries
  - type: content
    pattern: "(task|phase|step|next|continue|proceed)"

actions:
  - type: enforce
    message: |
      The Cursor Agent must proceed sequentially through the task list in `PROJECT_PLAN.md`.
      
      Key requirements:
      - Each task should be completed in order, as described in the plan, before moving to the next task
      - No task should be skipped or performed out of order unless explicitly instructed
      - Each completed task should be verified before advancing
      - Follow the exact sequence outlined in the project plan phases

  - type: suggest
    message: |
      When working with PROJECT_PLAN.md:
      
      1. Always check the current phase and task number
      2. Complete the current task fully before moving to the next
      3. Verify task completion with appropriate testing or validation
      4. Only proceed to the next task after current task is confirmed complete
      5. If a task fails, address the issue before continuing

examples:
  - input: "What should I do next?"
    output: "Check PROJECT_PLAN.md for the next sequential task in the current phase"
  
  - input: "Can I skip this task?"
    output: "No, tasks must be completed in order unless explicitly instructed otherwise"
