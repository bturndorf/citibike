      When adding new tasks to PROJECT_PLAN.md:

      1. Always label tasks with sequential numbers:
         ```
         **Tasks:**
         1. First task description
         2. Second task description
         3. Third task description
         ```

      2. Use consistent numbering format:
         - Start with 1 for each new task list
         - Use Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, not i, ii, iii)
         - Follow with a period and space: "1. "
         - Maintain sequential order even when adding tasks in the middle

      3. For nested task lists, use hierarchical numbering:
         ```
         **Tasks:**
         1. Main task
           1.1. Sub-task A
           1.2. Sub-task B
         2. Another main task
           2.1. Sub-task C
         ```

      4. When referring to tasks elsewhere in the document:
         - Use the exact task number: "See Task 1.2 above"
         - Be specific about which task you're referencing
         - Update references if task numbers change

      5. Benefits of sequential labeling:
         - Clear reference points for discussions
         - Easy to track progress
         - Simple to refer to specific tasks
         - Maintains document organization

examples:
  - input: |
      **Tasks:**
      - Set up database
      - Create API endpoints
      - Deploy application

      # Should be:
      **Tasks:**
      1. Set up database
      2. Create API endpoints
      3. Deploy application
    output: "Tasks properly labeled with sequential numbers"

  - input: |
      **Tasks:**
      1. First task
      3. Third task
      # Missing task 2

      # Should be:
      **Tasks:**
      1. First task
      2. Second task
      3. Third task
    output: "Tasks numbered sequentially without gaps"
